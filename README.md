# 🌍 World Population Analysis (1970–2022)

This project explores global population trends from 1970 to 2022 using historical data broken down by continent. The analysis uncovers patterns, correlations, and changes in population distribution to provide meaningful insights into demographic growth over time.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** World Population CSV file  
- **Features:** Country, Continent, Population by Year (1970–2022), World Population Percentage

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze population trends across different continents from 1970 to 2022
- Identify the top contributors to global population growth
- Visualize correlations between yearly population data
- Compare average population by continent

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
  - `pandas` – Data cleaning, grouping, and analysis
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Asia** remains the most populous continent, followed by **Africa**, which is showing rapid growth.
- Positive correlations exist between population growth across all decades.
- **Oceania** contributes the least to world population but maintains steady growth.
- Line plots and heatmaps help identify continent-specific trends and inter-year growth patterns.
